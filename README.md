# Precision Buffer with Low Input Capacitance

Following project briefly describes buffer developed for the EMPIR project QuADC. Main requirement was flatness below 0.1 µV/V up to 10 kHz. Calibration uncertainty at 1 MHz requirement was 5 µV/V. Input capacitance as low as possible. Output impedance as low as possible.
